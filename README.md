A game made for Spring 2D Jam '25 with the theme of *Overgrown*. 

## Story

In a world scarred by endless acid rain, a single tree stands as the last symbol of life. In [Game Title], you must explore fleeting clearings between storms, gather precious resources, and build defenses to shield the fragile tree from the corrosive skies. Face brutal weather, shifting winds, and lingering acid puddles as you fight to survive each storm. Water the tree to restore its strength, fortify it with sap and shelter, and hold on for as long as you can. As the world decays, your perseverance might just let life overgrow the ruins once again.
